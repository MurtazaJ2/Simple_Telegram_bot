# Simple_Telegram_bot

i have used a module called python-telegram-bot, This library provides a pure Python interface for the Telegram Bot API.
It’s compatible with Python versions 3.6.8+.
In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features a number of high-level classes to make the development of bots easy and straightforward.
These classes are contained in the “telegram.ext” submodule.
For more information, you can check their official GitHub repo.
